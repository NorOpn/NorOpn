- 👋 Hi, I’m @NorOpn and I’m the Senior Product Manager on Opn Store team. I joined Opn on 1 Feb 2022. Previously, I was a Product Manager at a SaaS Digital Signage product and have been wearing many hats at the different stages of the product lifecycle. 
- 👀 I fell in love with the Product Management craft and want to build product that helps solve customers heartfelt problem. I hope to bring my knowledge to Opn, to help build a product-led company, and learn from everyone.
- 🌱 My goal for 2022 is to spread the words about Product Management and how good product management practices can make a difference to the way we build things!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Opn Store project
- 📫 You can reach me on slack and I'm on most social apps under @nor99
